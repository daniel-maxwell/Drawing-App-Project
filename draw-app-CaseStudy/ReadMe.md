# Draw App - by Daniel White

The Draw app was a project I undertook during the second semester of my Computer Science degree. The aim was to create a browser-based drawing tool comparable to MS Paint with scaled-down / simplified functionality.

## Usage

The demo app should work fine in your browser. Simply open the index.html file in any modern browser.
